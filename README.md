## Arithmetic Unit Verification Calc1 and Calc3

<ul>
  <li>Developed and implemented comprehensive verification plans for two arithmetic units: Calc1 and Calc3.</li>
  <li>For Calc1: Designed a verification plan to validate the functionality of the arithmetic unit against design specifications, ensuring accurate input-output performance.</li>
  <li>For Calc3: Utilized the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) to verify the arithmetic unit using SystemVerilog for robust testbench development.</li>
  <li>Implemented a modular testbench architecture following UVM principles, including components such as Sequencer, Driver, Monitor, Scoreboard, and Checker.</li>
  <li>Designed transactions and sequences to simulate various scenarios and corner cases, ensuring thorough coverage of functional requirements.</li>
  <li>Integrated mailbox-based communication between the Agent and Driver to manage transaction flow efficiently.</li>
  <li>Developed a Predictor in the Scoreboard to compare expected outputs (PX) with actual DUT outputs (O/P), enabling automated result validation.</li>
  <li>Conducted regression testing to ensure consistent behavior across multiple simulation runs and design iterations.</li>
  <li>Documented verification results, including coverage metrics and debug logs, for future reference and debugging.</li>
</ul>
